## Why Squircle?

- The squircle is an intermediate shape between a square and a circle, present in digital and real
  products as well.
- While the corners of a rounded square remain at 90-degree angle, the edges of a squircle curve
  smoothly outwards from each corner, therefore creating an optically pleasing shape.
- The human brain perceives rounded corners (especially the smoother ones) easier and faster than sharp corners.

<br/>

---

## Gradle Kotlin DSL Setup (For Multiplatform projects).

##### Step 1

* Add the Squircle Shape dependency in your common module `build.gradle.kts` file.
* Latest version: ![Maven Central Version](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/io.github.stoyan-vuchev/squircle-shape)

```kotlin
sourceSets {
    
    val commonMain by getting {
        
        dependencies {
            
            // ...
            
            implementation("io.github.stoyan-vuchev:squircle-shape:<version>")
          
        }
      
    }

    // ...
  
}
```

* Or if you're using a version catalog (e.g. `libs.versions.toml`), declare it in the catalog instead.

```toml
[versions]
squircle-shape = "<version>"

[libraries]
squircle-shape = { group = "io.github.stoyan-vuchev", name = "squircle-shape", version.ref = "squircle-shape" }
```

* Then include the dependency in your shared module `build.gradle.kts` file.

```kotlin
sourceSets {

  val commonMain by getting {

    dependencies {

      // ...

      implementation(libs.squircle.shape)

    }

  }

  // ...

}
```

#### Step 2

    // Legacy Dependency (Lib. Version < 2.0.0).
    // implementation("com.github.stoyan-vuchev:squircle-shape:<version>")
            
    // New Dependency (Lib. Version >= 2.0.0).
    implementation("io.github.stoyan-vuchev:squircle-shape-android:<version>")
  
}
```

* Or if you're using a version catalog (e.g. `libs.versions.toml`), declare it in the catalog instead.

```toml

[libraries]

# Legacy Dependency (Lib. Version < 2.0.0).

# New Dependency (Lib. Version >= 2.0.0)
squircle-shape = { group = "io.github.stoyan-vuchev", name = "squircle-shape-android", version.ref = "squircle-shape" }
```

* Then include the dependency in your module `build.gradle.kts` file.

```kotlin
dependencies {

  // ...

  implementation(libs.squircle.shape)

}
```

## Usage

* For components, use `SquircleShape()`, which comes in multiple variants for multiple use cases, so
  different variants have different parameters (percent: Float, radius: Dp, etc.).
* However, there is a single common parameter in all variants - `cornerSmoothing: Float`.
* The `cornerSmoothing` as you may have or may have not guessed, is responsible for adjusting the
  smoothness of the corners, the foundation of every squircle shape.


* Take a look at
  the [SquircleShape.kt](/library/src/commonMain/kotlin/sv/lib/squircleshape/SquircleShape.kt)
  and [CornerSmoothing.kt](/library/src/commonMain/kotlin/sv/lib/squircleshape/CornerSmoothing.kt)
  files for more information.


* For a single percent based corner radius, use the variant of `SquircleShape()` with `precent: Int`
  and `cornerSmoothing: Float` parameters.

```kotlin
SquircleShape(
    percent = 100,
    cornerSmoothing = CornerSmoothing.Medium
)
```

* There are also a pixel (Float) and dp (Dp) based variants.


* For a multiple percent based corner radii, use the variant of `SquircleShape()`
  with `topStart: Int`, `topEnd: Int`, `bottomStart: Int`, `bottomEnd: Int`,
  and `cornerSmoothing: Float` parameters.

```kotlin
SquircleShape(
    topStart = 50,
    topEnd = 10,
    bottomStart = 50,
    bottomEnd = 10,
    cornerSmoothing = CornerSmoothing.Medium
)
```

* There are also a pixel (Float) and dp (Dp) based variants.


* Here is an example use of a Button using the default `SquircleShape()`.

```kotlin
Button(
    onClick = { /* Action */ },
    shape = SquircleShape() // Fully rounded squircle shape.
) {
    Text(text = "Full Squircle")
}
```

![Button with Full Squircle shape.](./readme_images/full_squircle.png)

* This is an example of Image clipped to the default `SquircleShape()`.

```kotlin
Image(
    modifier = Modifier
        .size(128.dp)
        .clip(shape = SquircleShape()), // Clipped to a fully rounded squircle shape.
    painter = painterResource(R.drawable.mlbb_novaria),
    contentDescription = "An image of Novaria.",
    contentScale = ContentScale.Crop
)
```

![A portrait image of Novaria from MLBB clipped to a Squircle shape.](./readme_images/mlbb_novaria.png)

* There is also a support for drawing squircle shapes in Canvas - `drawSquircle()`.
* All methods for creating a squircle shape use the `squircleShapePath()`. You can find it inside
  the [SquircleShapePath.kt](/library/src/commonMain/kotlin/sv/lib/squircleshape/SquircleShapePath.kt)
  file.
