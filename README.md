> A Compose Multiplatform library providing customizable Squircle shapes for UI components.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Customizable Squircle Shapes**: Create UI shapes that smoothly transition between squares and circles.
- **Integration with `MaterialTheme`**: Use squircle shapes directly in Jetpack Compose themes.
- **Corner Smoothing**: Fine-tune the smoothness of corners for a delightful design.
- **Multiplatform Support**: Available for Android, iOS, Desktop (JVM), and Web (WasmJS).
- **Canvas Drawing**: Easily draw squircle shapes on canvases with `drawSquircle()`.

---

## üÜï What's New in Version 4.0.0?

- **Added a new shape type**:  
  A new shape type called *Gentle Squircle* was added. The goal of this shape is to be used in scenarios
  where the shape must gently transition from a squircle to a perfectly round circle without specifying a smoothing value.

- **Fixed corner radius to smoothing scaling**:  
  The corner smoothing no longer scales down the corner radius.

- **Fixed RTL & LTR layout direction mirroring**:  
  The logic for RTL & LTR layout direction mirroring is fixed.

## üì¶ Setup

### Gradle Kotlin DSL (Multiplatform)

1. Add the dependency in your shared module's `build.gradle.kts`:
```kotlin
sourceSets {
    
    val commonMain by getting {
        
        dependencies {
            
            // ...
            
            implementation("io.github.stoyan-vuchev:squircle-shape:<version>")
          
        }
      
    }

    // ...
  
}
```

* Or if you're using a version catalog (e.g. `libs.versions.toml`), declare it in the catalog instead.

```toml
[versions]
squircle-shape = "<version>"

[libraries]
squircle-shape = { group = "io.github.stoyan-vuchev", name = "squircle-shape", version.ref = "squircle-shape" }
```

* Then include the dependency in your shared module `build.gradle.kts` file.

```kotlin
sourceSets {

  val commonMain by getting {

    dependencies {

      // ...

      implementation(libs.squircle.shape)

    }

  }

  // ...

}
```

2. Sync and rebuild the project. üîÑÔ∏èüî®‚úÖ

squircle-shape = "<version>"

[libraries]
squircle-shape = { group = "io.github.stoyan-vuchev", name = "squircle-shape-android", version.ref = "squircle-shape" }

## üöÄ Usage

### 1. **Using Squircle Shapes with `MaterialTheme`**

Define squircle shapes in your theme to use them consistently across your app:

```kotlin
val shapes = Shapes(
    small = SquircleShape(radius = 16.dp, cornerSmoothing = CornerSmoothing.Medium),
    medium = SquircleShape(radius = 32.dp, cornerSmoothing = CornerSmoothing.Medium),
    large = SquircleShape(percent = 100, cornerSmoothing = CornerSmoothing.Medium)
)

MaterialTheme(
    shapes = shapes
) {

    // ...

    Button(
        onClick = { /* Action */ },
        shape = MaterialTheme.shapes.large // Clipped to the provided `large` material theme shape.
    ) {
        Text(text = "Full Squircle")
    }

    // ...

}
```

### 2. **Using Squircle Shapes separately**

Clip UI components separately by using a `SquircleShape()` function.

```kotlin
Image(
    modifier = Modifier
        .size(128.dp)
        .clip(
            shape = SquircleShape(
                percent = 100,
                cornerSmoothing = CornerSmoothing.Medium
            )
        ), // Clipped to a fully rounded squircle shape.
    painter = painterResource(R.drawable.mlbb_novaria),
    contentDescription = "An image of Novaria.",
    contentScale = ContentScale.Crop
)
```

You can customize the radii for all corners, or for each corner independently.
Supported corner values are:

- `Int` for percent-based corner radius in range 0..100 
- `Float` for pixel-based corner radius e.g. `50f`
- `Dp` for density pixel-based corner radius e.g. `16.dp`

```kotlin
// Single-corner percent-based radius implementation.
SquircleShape(
    percent = 100,
    cornerSmoothing = .6f
)

// Single-corner pixel-based radius implementation.
SquircleShape(
    radius = 32f,
    cornerSmoothing = .6f
)

// Single-corner density pixel-based radius implementation.
SquircleShape(
    radius = 32.dp,
    cornerSmoothing = .6f
)

// Multi-corner percent-based radius implementation.
SquircleShape(
    topStart = 25,
    topEnd = 5,
    bottomStart = 25,
    bottomEnd = 5,
    cornerSmoothing = .6f
)

// Multi-corner pixel-based radius implementation.
SquircleShape(
    topStart = 32f,
    topEnd = 8f,
    bottomStart = 32f,
    bottomEnd = 8f,
    cornerSmoothing = .6f
)

// Multi-corner density pixel-based radius implementation.
SquircleShape(
    topStart = 32.dp,
    topEnd = 8.dp,
    bottomStart = 32.dp,
    bottomEnd = 8.dp,
    cornerSmoothing = .6f
)
```

### 3. Draw a Squircle on Canvas

You can draw squircle shapes on a canvas for custom graphics.

Note: currently `drawSquircle` only accepts pixel-based values for each corner:

```kotlin
Canvas(
    modifier = Modifier.size(150.dp),
    onDraw = {
    
        drawSquircle(
            color = Color.Blue,
            topLeft = Offset.Zero,
            size = this.size,
            topLeftCorner = 32.dp.toPx(),
            topRightCorner = 8.dp.toPx(),
            bottomRightCorner = 32.dp.toPx(),
            bottomLeftCorner = 8.dp.toPx(),
            cornerSmoothing = .6f
        )
    
    }
)
```
