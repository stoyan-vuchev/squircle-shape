/**
 * Creates an outline for a [SquircleShape], considering corner radii, smoothing, and layout direction.
 *
 * @param size The overall size of the shape as a [Size] object.
 * @param topStart The radius of the top-start corner in pixels. In left-to-right layouts, this corresponds to the top-left corner.
 * @param topEnd The radius of the top-end corner in pixels. In left-to-right layouts, this corresponds to the top-right corner.
 * @param bottomEnd The radius of the bottom-end corner in pixels. In left-to-right layouts, this corresponds to the bottom-right corner.
 * @param bottomStart The radius of the bottom-start corner in pixels. In left-to-right layouts, this corresponds to the bottom-left corner.
 * @param smoothing An Integer value between 0 and 100 that determines the smoothing of the corners.
 * @param upscaleCornerSize A Boolean value indicating whether to upscale the corner size.
 * @param layoutDirection The layout direction of the shape, specified as [LayoutDirection.Ltr] or [LayoutDirection.Rtl].
 *                        This affects how the corner radii are applied.
 * @return An [Outline] object representing the shape's boundary:
 *         - Returns a generic path representing the squircle shape.
 *
 * ##### Behavior:
 * - Clamps the corner radii to ensure they fit within the size of the shape.
 * - Adjusts corner radii based on the layout direction, swapping left and right corners in RTL layouts.
 * - Applies corner smoothing using the provided `smoothing` parameter to create a squircle-like effect.
